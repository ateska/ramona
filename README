Ramona
======

Ramona is an enterprise-grade runtime supervisor that allows controlling and monitoring software programs during their execution life cycle.

It is primarily meant to be blended into your project source code set to provide supervisor/console functionality of init.d-like start/stop control, task frontend (e.g. unit/functional/performance test launcher) and other command-line oriented features. It should ideally represent the only executable of the project - kind of 'dispatcher' to rest of a project. It is design the way that you should be able to extend that easily if needed (e.g. to include your own tasks).
